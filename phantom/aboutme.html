							<h3 id="bs-header">My Backstory</h3>
							<div>
							<p>I was born in Virginia, in a small suburb outside of Richmond called Midlothian. When I was in 4th grade, my family moved to State College, Pennsylvania where I spent the rest of my formative years.</p>
							<p>I attended Carnegie Mellon University where I was a member of the Varsity Football and Track & Field teams. I graduated in 2019 with a degree in Neuroscience. Feeling unsatisfied with life in academia, I chose to not pursue a Ph.D.</p>
							<p>I fell in love with software development because it is intellectually stimulating, challenging, and creative. In my two years of experience, I have been chief engineer of three web applications, two of which were developed by the software company I co-founded, <a href="https://greenstargroup.org" target="_blank">Greenstar Group, Inc</a>.</p>

							<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
							<strong style="margin-bottom:30px;">Carnegie Mellon</strong><br><br>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="../assets/img/cmu-square-tn.png"></span>I went to Carnegie Mellon University, studying business for a few years as well as earning a degree in Cognitive Neuroscience. I also took a number of statistics, mathematics, and computer programming courses in which I excelled and thoroughly enjoyed. One thing I learned from CMU outside the classroom is what it means to have grit; how to overcome adversity. As you'll read below my journey was never a straightforward one. Earning my degree taught me a lot about my ability to perform at a high level regardless of circumstance.</p>
							<p>I have learned more about software development outside the classrooms in Pittsburgh, but college proved to me that I have the ability to think critically and to understand and manipulate complex systems for a productive outcome. I earned a 3.87 GPA in my Neuroscience core curriculum which included graduate-level courses such as Parallel and Distributed Processing, where I programmed my own neural network, and Systems Neuroscience, which viewed the brain as a computational unit with various classes of neurons acting as the logic gates inside of a CPU.</p>

							<strong style="padding-bottom:30px;">Integrative Bodywork School of Massage</strong><br><br>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="../assets/img/ibsmt-tn.png"></span>In the heart of my college tenure, I had to take a leave of absence due to financial reasons. I capitalized on this opportunity by expanding into an area that my family has long had history in and had taken a personal interest in myself. I enrolled in Massage Therapy school to learn more about the natural world, health, and the human body.</p><p>During this experience I was fortunate enough to practice sports massage therapy on prominent athletes, most notably Saquon Barkley and Chris Godwin of the NFL&reg;, among many others. While stories like those are fun to tell over drinks with friends, what I really got out of it was an appreciation for the richness and the majesty of the world in which we all live.</p><p>I earned an accredited degree in massage therapy and practiced briefly while working as a Domino's delivery boy, a crew member at Jersey Mike's, a bouncer downtown at a Penn State college bar, and an assistant coach for my old middle school Track & Field team.</p>
